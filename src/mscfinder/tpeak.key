			Cursor Keystroke Commands

 a  All source toggle for d/i/j/k/l/u keys.  Entering `a' before one of
    these keystrokes will make the action apply either to all sources for
    d[elete] or u[ndelete], or to all currently uncentered (bad) sources
    for i[nitialize] and the three centering keys:  `j', `k', or `l'.

 b  Redisplay only the bad (uncentered) sources.
 c  Recenter the list of sources with good (previously centered) positions.
 d  Delete the source(s).  (Mark as uncentered.)
 f  Fit good source list, reposition uncentered sources to match.
    If ":update" is "yes", write the resulting world coordinate system
    (WCS) into the input image header.
 g  Redisplay only the good (centered) sources.
 i  Initialize the source(s) to their raw coordinates.

 j  Center the source(s) at the current coordinates.
 k  Center the source(s) shifted to the cursor, using one keystroke.
 l  Center the source(s) shifted to the cursor, using two keystrokes.

    The `l' key allows an initial source selection keystroke for
    crowded fields (first 'l' selects source marker, second 'l'
    selects pixel coordinates).  The `k' key selects and shifts
    using only one cursor position (nearest marker to pixel).
    The `j' key only uses the cursor position for selecting the
    source marker to be centered from the catalog coordinates.

 o  Overlay the raw catalog coordinates using the omarker and the badcolor.
 q  Exit the task.
 r  Redisplay both the good and bad (centered and uncentered) sources.
 u  Undelete the source(s).  (Mark as centered - no further centering done.)
 ?  Get this help.


			Colon Commands

Issue a command with an argument of the specified type to set the
corresponding value, or with no argument to print the current setting.
Commands and arguments may be abbreviated.

 :autodisplay	[y/n]	Redisplay automatically after "all source" command?
 :boxsize	[int]	Centering box fullwidth
 :show		[file]	List plate, region and coordinate info [to a file]
 :subsample	[int]	Overlay subsampling factor for display only

 :badcolor	[str]	Color for bad (uncentered) positions
 :goodcolor	[str]	Color for good (centered) positions
 :marker	[str]	Marker for current positions
 :omarker	[str]	Marker for initial positions

		Colors:   [black|white|red|green|blue|yellow]
		Markers:  [point|circle|cross|plus|rectangle]

The "f" keystroke will perform a plate solution using the current list
of centered catalog sources.  This plate solution will be used to calculate
the celestial coordinates for the program object list, but can also
optionally be used to update the world coordinate system (WCS) in the
image header.  The WCS information can be used by a variety of IRAF tasks.
If ":update" is yes, the image header WCS will be updated following the
next fit.  If ":update" is no, the WCS will not be updated.

 :update	[y/n]	Update input image WCS after next fit?


The catalog sources (not program objects) can be repositioned from the
current coordinates by specifying a relative shift in each axis or a
rotation or percent scaling factor(s) that will be applied to all catalog
sources relative to the center of the frame.  If only one argument is
specified to :scale, both coordinates are rescaled by the same factor.

Note that each time rotate, scale or shift is specified, the coordinates
will be recomputed relative to the current coordinates, centered or not.
These commands will often best be applied to the original predicted
coordinates immediately after entering the task or after reinitializing
the coordinates using the "a" and "i" keystrokes.  No centering is
performed following these commands, and the catalog sources will be
marked as uncentered afterwards.

 :rotate	[real]	Angle relative to current coordinates
 :scale [x [y]] [real]	Percent scale factor (can specify each axis)
 :shift [x y]	[int]	X,Y shifts relative to current coordinates

Special circumstances may benefit from updating the original predicted
coordinates provided by TFIELD.  The :replace command will reset these
coordinates to the current coordinates.  This operation should not
normally need to be performed.

 :replace		Replace the predicted coords with the current coords

Note that the "predicted" program object coordinates will be updated also.


Various parameters from the various tasks called by TPEAK may be adjusted
to tweak the behavior of the task:

 :eparam	[task]	Edit parameters for DISPLAY, IMCENTROID,
			SELECTPARS, TPLTSOL or TVMARK

All the parameters of DISPLAY are adjustable (excluding the image name
and frame number which are set by TPEAK) and most of the parameters of
TVMARK are adjustable.  This allows control over the appearance of the
display.  The IMCENTROID parameters can be tweaked to refine the
centering algorithm and the TPLTSOL parameters to refine the interactive
coordinate fitting algorithm.

One useful technique is to set tvmark.outimage before redisplaying the
good (and/or bad) sources for the last time (reset tvmark.outimage
before exiting the task).  This provides a snapshot of the overlayed
sources suitable for hardcopy.
