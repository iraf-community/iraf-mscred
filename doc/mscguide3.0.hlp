1. Introduction

This document discusses the handling and reduction of CCD mosaic data.  The
software and the discussions are applicable to all CCD mosaic data
which use the multiextension FITS format described below.  This includes
the NOAO mosaic imagers as well as similar instruments from AAO, CFA, CFHT,
ESO, INT, and possibly others that I am not aware of.  However, this
presentation is also intended as a user's guide for the NOAO Mosaic images
(currently the two 8-CCD mosaics at KPNO and CTIO and the 2-CCD mosaic at
WIYN).  Therefore some discussion concerns effects which may be (or may
not be) specific to these systems.

The NOAO Mosaic Data Handling System (MDHS) includes data acquisition,
real-time, data reduction, pipeline, and archiving software.  While all of
the components of the MDHS may be used with a variety of instruments this
document discusses only the telescope and data reduction tools which are
part of the IRAF \fBmscred\fP package or general IRAF packages.

This guide is not a beginner's guide and assumes some previous experience
with IRAF and CCD reductions.

The first section discusses the mosaic data format and how to use it with
IRAF.  This format is more complex than single CCD images because of the
multiple CCDs and, possibly, multiple amplifiers per CCD.  To keep the data
from each exposure self-contained the multiple CCD images are stored in a
single file.  This multiple image per file has many advantages but it does
mean that some commands for dealing with images behave differently.

The second section describes the tools used to examine the mosaic data.
These tools are used during observing as well as during data reductions.

The last section describes the reduction of mosaic data.  This includes
basic CCD instrumental calibration and combining mosaic exposures into
single images.

.sh
2. Multiextension FITS Files

The data format used by the NOAO Mosaic Data Handling Software (MDHS) is a
multiextension FITS (MEF) file.  This format is produced by the the Data
Capture Agent (DCA) when observing with the NOAO mosaic cameras.  For
example the MEF file for the NOAO 8K mosaics currently consists of either
nine or seventeen FITS header and data units (HDU).  The first HDU, called
the primary or global header unit, contains only header information which
is common to all the CCD images.  The remaining eight or sixteen HDUs,
called extensions, contain the images from the eight CCDs using either one
amplifier per CCD or two amplifiers per CCD.

The fact that the image data is stored as a FITS file is not significant.
Starting with IRAF V2.11, FITS files consisting of just a single primary
image may be used in the same way as any other IRAF image format.  The
significant feature of the mosaic format is its multi-image structure.  For
a detailed discussion of the IRAF FITS Image Kernel and the syntax it
supports for multiextension FITS files see
ftp://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/docs/fits_userguide.ps.Z.

With multiextension FITS files you must either use tasks which are
specifically designed to operate on these files as a unit or explicitly
specify the image within the file that is to be operated upon by general
IRAF image processing tasks.  The tasks in the \fBmscred\fR package are
designed to operate on the mosaic MEF files and so in most cases you only
need to specify the filename.  For image tasks outside the \fBmscred\fR
package you must specify the image in the MEF file using the syntax

.nf
    filename[extension]
.fi

where "filename" is the name of the MEF file.  The ".fits" filename
extension is optional provided there is no confusion with other files with
the same basename.  The image "extension" is specified either using an
extension name or the position of the extension in the file (where the
first extension is 1).  For example, the extension names in the NOAO mosaic
data are "im1" through "im8" for eight CCDs.  The same format applies for
the sixteen dual-amplifier readouts and for the four dual-amplifier
extensions in the WIYN 2-CCD mosaic.  To get a listing of the extension
names use the following command

.nf
    ms> msccmd "hselect $input $I,extname yes" [filename]
.fi

If you forget to specify an extension to a task that expects only
single images you will get the following error which is your reminder
to include an extension.

.nf
    ms> imhead obj012 1
    ERROR: FXF: must specify which FITS extension (obj012)
.fi

Two of the most common tasks that require specifying an image extension
are \fBdisplay\fR to display a single CCD image (the task \fBmscdisplay\fR
is used to display all the images at once) and \fBimheader\fR to list
the header of a particular CCD.  So, for example, the following commands
might be used.

.nf
    ms> display obj012[im2] 1
    ms> imhead obj012[3] l+
.fi

Other tasks you may use this way are \fBimexam\fR and \fBimplot\fR.

A common question is how to specify a list of extensions.  Modification of
the syntax to allow wildcard templates in the extension specification is
under study.  Currently you must specify each extension explicitly, though
the filename itself may be a wildcard; for example the first image in a set
of files can be collectively specified with

.nf
    obj*[im1]
.fi

There are two methods for specifying some or all extensions in tasks that
operate upon lists of images.  One is to make @files.  This can be done
explicitly with an editor.  However the \fBproto\fR task \fBimextensions\fR
can expand MEF files into an @file as in the following example.

.nf
    ms> imexten obj012,obj13 > list
    ms> imhead @list
.fi

Read the help page for further information, additional parameters, and
examples.

Another method is to use the special \fBmscred\fR task \fBmsccmd\fR.  This
task can be used on the command line or as a simple interactive command
interpreter.  The idea is that you use the special designations "$input"
and "$output" for task parameters which allow lists of images.  Then
lists of MEF filenames are specified for the input and output which are
expanded and substituted into the task parameters when it is executed.
For example,

.nf
    ms> msccmd "imhead $input l+" input=obj012,obj013
.fi

For additional information and examples consult the help page for that task.

Note that the tasks \fBimstat\fR and \fBimarith\fR are so useful and common
that there are specific \fBmscred\fR tasks, \fBmscstat\fR and \fBmscarith\fR,
that operate on all or a subset of image extensions.  So these tasks need
not be used with \fBmsccmd\fR or with @files.

We conclude with a discussion of the special operations of copying,
renaming, deleting, and reading and writing FITS tapes as they apply to the
mosaic MEF files.  To copy a mosaic file as a unit use \fBcopy\fR, making
sure to explicitly specify the "fits" extension.  If you use \fBimcopy\fR
it will expect you to specify a particular extension and will copy only
that extension.  While \fBimcopy\fR is not the way to copy an complete MEF
file the tasks \fBimrename\fR and \fBimdelete\fR are the commands for
renaming and deleting these files; though \fBrename\fR and \fBdelete\fR
will also work provided you are explicit with the extension.  Finally the
mosaic data should be kept as a MEF file and so the special mosaic
tasks \fBmscwfits\fR and \fBmscrfits\fR should be used.  The current
\fBwfits\fR and \fBrfits\fR are not intended for this type of data.

2.1 Keywords

The discussion above is independent of keywords apart for those required
by the FITS standard for extensions.  The only explicit keyword needed
above is the EXTNAME keyword to specify the extension names that can
be used to refer to the extensions by the IRAF software.

However, the discussion that follows for using the \fBmscred\fR mosaic
reduction tools requires the MEF files to have certain keywords.  Some
of the keywords are needed for basic display, some for basic CCD processing,
and some for astrometric registration.  The NOAO mosaic data includes all
the necessary keywords.  Other observatories provide some the keywords
either in a form directly needed by the MSCRED tools or which can be
converted to the appropriate form.  For a discussion of how to setup
the basic keywords for data which does not have it see
http://iraf.noao.edu/projects/ccdmosaic/generic/generic.html.  A complete
description of the keywords and the mosaic data structure see
http://iraf.noao.edu/projects/ccdmosaic/imagedef/imagedef.html.

A case where the keyword information is not in the correct format but is
present in the data is the ESO Wide-Field Imager (ESOWFI).  A special IRAF
add-on package is available to translate the raw data format into the form
required by the MSCRED tools.  This package is called ESOWFI and may be
obtained from extern directory of the various IRAF mirror sites.

.sh
3. Examining Mosaic Data

During observing a small set of IRAF commands are commonly used to examine
the data.  This section describes these commands.  While the discussion is
oriented towards examining the data at the telescope during the course of
observing, the tools described here are also used when reducing data at a
later time.

.sh
3.1 Displaying the Data

The two commands \fBdisplay\fR and \fBmscdisplay\fR are used to display the
data in a display server window.  The display server is a separate process
which must be running before displaying the images.  The observing
environment at the telescope will generally have the XIMTOOL display server
already running with a window on a separate monitor.  If it is not running
for some reason it can be started with a menu selection.  Away from the
telescope you would start XIMTOOL or SAOIMAGE as you do normally.

The display server must be told what size "frame buffer" to allocate for
holding the display pixels.  This determines how many pixels may be loaded
at one time.  Note that the display window may be smaller than this size
and the display server allows you to move the portion viewed and
zoom/unzoom any region.  If the image size is larger than the frame buffer
you can display a portion of the image at full resolution or the full image
at a lower resolution.  The frame buffer size is queried and set with the
commands:

.nf
    ms> show stdimage
    imt4096
    ms> set stdimage=imt2048
.fi

There are trade-offs in the frame buffer selection.  A large frame buffer
allows you to have higher resolution for the large mosaic images but it
uses more memory and takes longer to load.

The \fBdisplay\fR task is used to display individual images in the display
server.  This task is a standard IRAF task about which you are assumed to
have some basic knowledge.  There are many display options which
are discussed in the help page.  The only special factor in using this
task with mosaic data is that you must specify which CCD image to display
using the image extension syntax discussed previously.  As an example,
to display the central portion of extension im3 in the first frame
and the whole image in the second frame:

.nf
    ms> display obj123[im3] 1 fill-
    ms> display obj123[im3] 2 fill+
.fi

The \fBmscdisplay\fR task is based on \fBdisplay\fR with a number of
specialized enhancements for displaying mosaic data.  It displays the
entire mosaic observation in a single frame by "filling" each image in a
tiled region of the frame buffer.  The default filling (defined by the
order parameter) subsamples the image by uniform integer steps to fit the
tile and then replicates pixels to scale to the full tile size.  The
resolution is set by the frame buffer size.  As mentioned before, trying to
increase the resolution with a larger buffer size has the penalty of longer
display times.  An example display command is:

.nf
    ms> mscdisplay obj123 1
.fi

The default parameters for \fBmscdisplay\fR are shown below.  Many of the
parameters are the same as \fBdisplay\fR but there are also a few that are
specific to the task of displaying a mosaic of CCD images as indicated with
an asterisk.

.nf
			       I R A F

    PACKAGE = mscred
       TASK = mscdisplay

    (ztrans =   linear) greylevel transformation (linear|log|none|user)
    (lutfile=         ) file containing user defined look up table
.fi

The mapping of the pixel values to grey levels includes the same automatic
or range scaling algorithms as in \fBdisplay\fR.  This is done for each
image in the mosaic separately.  The new parameter "zcombine" then selects
whether to display each image with it's own independent display range
("none") or to combine the display ranges into a single display range based
on the minimum and maximum values ("minmax"), the average of the minimum
and maximum values ("average"), or the median ("median") of the minimum and
maximum values.  The independent scaling is most appropriate for raw data
while the "minmax" scaling is recommend for processed data which are gain
calibrated.  The special value "auto" (the default) checks if the display
data has been flat fielded, either by separate processing or with
on-the-fly calibration, and if so it uses "minmax" scaling and if not it
used independent scaling.

The "mimpars" (mosaic image parameters) parameter is actually a reference
to another set of parameters.  The default with no value is to use the
parameters from the parameter task \fBmimpars\fR.  These parameters can
be examined and set with \fBepar\fR  either by typing ":e" when over this
parameter in \fBmscdisplay\fR or by running \fBepar\fR directly on this
task; i.e. epar mimpars.  The parameters for NOAO Mosaic data are shown below.

.nf
			   I R A F  
	    Image Reduction and Analysis Facility
    PACKAGE = mscred
       TASK = mimpars

    (extname=         ) extension name pattern
    (exttmpl= _![1-9]![1-9]![1-9].*) extension template

    (xgap   =       72) minimum X gap between images
    (ygap   =       36) minimum Y gap between images

    (process=       no) do calibration processing?
    (oversca=      yes) do line-by-line overscan subtraction?
    (flatfie=      yes) do flat field correction?
    (caldir = mscdb$noao/kpno/4meter/caldir/) calibration directory
    (filter =  !filter) filter
.fi

The "extname" parameter is used to select as subset of the image extensions to
display.  It is a pattern to match extension image names.  For extensions
such as im1, im2, etc. the pattern typically uses the character selection
template such as "[1256]" to select anything with a 1, 2, 5, or 6 in
the name.  The pattern matching syntax can be found in the help for
the task \fBmatch\fR.

The "exttmplt" parameter is for use with non-MEF data.  The gap parameters
define the gap size in the display.  The remaining parameters are for
the on-the-fly calibration discussed below.

.sh
3.1.1 On-the-Fly (OTF) Calibration

Raw mosaic data can exhibit significant instrumental artifacts which may
interfere with inspecting the data prior to reductions.  The most significant
artifact is gain variations both within each CCD image and between the
CCDs.  In the simplest case of constant gain variations between the CCDs
the independent display scaling, "zcombine" of none or auto, may be
sufficient.  But when there are significant flat field patterns it may
be desirable to apply a quick, approximate flat field calibration as
the data are being displayed.

\fBMscdisplay\fR can apply an on-the-fly (OTF) calibration to raw mosaic
exposures.  This does not change the actual data files and the calibration
is intended to be quick and approximate.  The calibration steps performed
are a line-by-line bias subtraction using the overscan region of the data
and a division by a flat field.  If the data have been overscan corrected
or flat field corrected by \fBccdproc\fR then the task will automatically
skip those steps.  The title of the display will indicate if the data have
been calibrated by adding "[bias]" for bias subtraction and
"[bias,flat=XXX]" for bias subtraction and flat fielding using an OTF flat
field called XXX.

The bias subtraction is performed by averaging the overscan pixels in a
line and subtracting this average from all the pixels in the line.  This
removes the amplifier bias and line-by-line patterns.

The flat field or response calibration is performed by reading special
compact flat field calibration data which provides an approximate relative
response for each pixel in each amplifier readout.  Depending on how the
calibration file is derived this will approximately correct for pixel
sensitivity variations, gain variations between the amplifiers, sky
illumination variations, and any pupil ghost pattern (as occurs with NOAO
Mosaic data from the Mayall (KPNO 4meter) telescope).

The "process" parameter in the \fBmimpars\fR parameter set shown
earlier selects whether to turn on or off the OTF processing.  If it is no
then regardless of the "overscan" or "flatfield" parameter settings
no calibration is applied.  If it is yes then one or both calibration
operations can be selected.  Because the \fBmimpars\fR parameters can be
set on the command line, it is common to leave the "process" parameter set
one way, say to "no", and then override the value when displaying.  For
example,

.nf
    ms> mscdisplay obj023 1 proc+
    ms> mscdisplay flat022 2 proc+ flatfield-
.fi

The flat field calibration requires special calibration files.  The
"caldir" parameter defines a directory containing the calibration
files.  This can be a standard directory or a user directory.  Note
that if a directory is specified it must end with $ or /.

Within the calibration directory the calibration file to apply is selected
by the "filter" parameter.  For automatic selection of calibrations, the
calibrations can be selected by the filter string in the header (or by
giving the same filter string in the "filter" parameter).  To use the
filter string in the header the value of the filter parameter is set to
"!<keyword>" where <keyword> is the keyword for the filter string.

Creating the a calibration directory and calibration files is done with
the task \fBmscotfflat\fR.  For the NOAO Mosaic a calibration directory
is provided.  However you can create your own as described in the help
for \fBmscotfflat\fR.  The "filter" parameter
can be set to one of these names.

.sh
3.1.2 Real-Time Display with the DCA

During data acquisition the \fBmscdisplay\fR task can be used to display mosaic
data as it is being written to disk by the DCA.  It begins execution
shortly after the readout begins and displays the portion of the recorded
image which has been written to disk.  It then continually displays
new data which has been written by the DCA until the exposure is completely
written to the display.

The DCA control panel allows you to select whether to display the data
during readout and how it is to be displayed.  This includes selecting the
OTF calibration.  One toggle is equivalent to the "process" parameter.
If the processing is turned on the DCA automatically selects only overscan
bias subtraction for non-object exposures and selects both bias subtraction
and flat field division for object exposures.  The "filter" parameter
is set by passing through the filter string from the data acquisition
system or by overriding this and using the filter menu to select one of the
available calibrations.

.sh
3.2 Examining the Data

The task \fBmscexamine\fR allows interactive examination of mosaic images.
It is essentially the same as the standard \fBimexamine\fR task except that
it translates the cursor position in a tiled mosaic display into the image
coordinates of the appropriate extension image.  Line and column plots also
piece together the extensions at the particular line or column of the
mosaic display.  To enter the task after displaying an image the command
is:

.nf
    ms> mscexam
.fi

As with \fBimexamine\fR, one may specify the mosaic MEF filename to be
examined and if it is not currently displayed it will be displayed using the
current parameters of \fBmscdisplay\fR.

It is important to realize that this task shares the \fBmimpars\fR parameters
with \fBmscdisplay\fR.  To get data values back that match what is displayed
the parameters must agree with those used to display the data.  In particular,
if the data are display with OTF processing then \fBmscexam\fR must be
told this either by explicitly setting the process flat in \fBmimpars\fR
or setting it on the command line,

.nf
    ms> mscexam proc+
.fi

.sh
3.3 Examining the Headers

There was discussion earlier concerning the use of generic image tasks with the
NOAO Mosaic data.  The tasks \fBimheader\fR and \fBhselect\fR fall into
this category.  The two important points to keep in mind are that you must
specify either an extension name or the extension position and that the
headers of an extension are the combination of the global header and the
extension headers.

Often one does not need to list all the headers for all the extensions.
The image title and many keywords of interest are common to all the
extensions.  Thus one of the following commands will be sufficient
to get header information about an exposure or set of exposures:

.nf
    ms> imhead obj*[1] l-                       # Title listing
    ms> imhead obj123[1] l+ | page              # Paged long listing
    ms> hselect obj*[1] $I,filter,exptime,obstime yes 
.fi

If you need to list header information from all the extensions then you
need to take the additional step of creating an @file or using
\fBmsccmd\fR.  For example to get the default read noise and gain values
for each CCD:

.nf
    ms> imextensions obj123 > list123
    ms> hselect @list123 $I,rdnoise,gain yes
	    or
    ms> msccmd "hselect $input $I,rdnoise,gain yes" input=obj123
.fi

The \fBccdlist\fR task in the \fBmscred\fR package is specialized for the
mosaic data.  It provides a compact description of the name, title, pixel
type, filter, amplifier, and processing flags.  The "extname" parameter may
be used to select a particular extension, a set of extensions, or all
extensions.  Because all extensions should generally be at the same state
of reduction it may be desirable to list only the first extension.  Like
most of the CCD reduction tasks you can also select only a certain type of
exposure for listing.  Examples of the two modes are:

.nf
    # Summary for all exposures
    ms> ccdlist *.fits extname=im1
    # Summary for all object exposures
    ms> ccdlist *.fits extname=im1 ccdtype=object
    # List of all extensions.
    ms> ccdlist obj123 extname=""
.fi

.sh
3.4 Determining Best Focus

Focus sequence frames can be evaluated for the best focus using \fBmscexam\fR
and the 'r' or 'a' keys.  However, there is a special task for measuring
the sequence of focus images called
\fBmscfocus\fR.  This displays a focus exposure with \fBmscdisplay\fR (if
needed) and then lets you select one or more bright stars to measure.  This
task is customized so that all you need do is mark the top image in any
CCD.  For NOAO Mosaic data, header information tells the task how many
exposures, the spacings between the exposures, and the focus values.  After
the measurements are made they are displayed and analyzed graphically and
written to the terminal and logfile.  This task is the mosaic analog of the
\fBkpnofocus\fR and \fBstarfocus\fR tasks for single CCD data.

.sh
4.2.1  Calibration Data to Obtain At the Telescope

Good data reductions begin with obtaining good calibration data at the
telescope.  This section discusses the NOAO Mosaic but the general
principles will apply to other detectors, though the relative importance of
different calibrations will depend on the quality of the CCDs and the
stability of the camera.

The standard calibration data are sequences of zero exposures and
sequences of dome flat field exposures.  While dark count exposures,
matched to the typical object exposure times, were important for the
first generation (engineering grade) NOAO Mosaic, dark counts are expected
to be low in the science grade detectors.  Thus dark count exposures are
probably not necessary.

Dome flat fields (dome flats) provide a fair basic flattening of the data
to 2% or so, but sky flat fields (sky flats) are required to produce
dithered data that can be combined without introducing obvious artifacts.
Good sky flats can flatten the data to 0.1%.  In our experience twilight
exposures do not work well.  Instead dark sky flat fields are derived from
unregisted object exposures taken during the night or run.  If your
observing program consists of only large extended objects or single
pointings then you should also take some dithered exposures of "blank"
sky.

At the Mayall telescope there is a pupil image caused by reflections
off the corrector.  For broadband photometry the effects of the pupil
image are small but they can be reduced even further by reduction steps
to remove the image.  One useful calibration for this removal is a
narrowband dome flat field.  The idea is that the narrowband flat field
has a more prominent pupil image that can be used as a template for the
much fainter broadband pupil image.

Lastly, good astrometry is required to register and stack the Mosaic
images.  The NOAO Mosaic data contains previously determined astrometry
recorded in the headers of the raw exposures.  This is sufficient for most
purposes.  However, for cameras without astrometry or to generate your own
astrometry solutions, fields with a reasonable density of stars with
cataloged accurate coordinates must be taken.  Note that with the new
generation of large astrometric catalogs and the large field of view of a
mosaic, it may be that the object exposures already contain sufficient
information for deriving new astrometric calibrations or corrections.  Note
that this guide does not yet discuss how to create the astrometric
coordinate system solutions.

.sh
4. Data Reductions

The reduction of CCD mosaic data can be divided into two stages, the
basic photometric and astrometric calibration of the individual CCDs
and putting the pieces together into single images.  Another way to think
of this division is that in the first stage the pixels are not resampled
or interpolated while in the second stage they are.

The first stage is similar to reducing data from single CCD exposures
except that the calibration operations are repeated for all the CCDs in the
mosaic.  Some operations must also be constrained to maintain the
photometric and astrometric relationships between the CCDs.  The details of
repeating the calibrations for all CCDs and maintaining the relationships
are taken care of by the software and the data format so that these
operations appear similar to reducing single CCD data.

The steps in this stage consists of photometrically calibrating each pixel
and astrometrically calibrating the coordinate system mapping between pixel
coordinates and celestial coordinates.  The photometric calibration
includes flat fielding as well as removal of instrumental artifacts such as
amplifier crosstalk and reflections.  The astrometric calibration includes
determination of the basic coordinate system mapping and adjustments
for telescope pointing errors, instrumental rotation, and atmospheric
refraction.

The second stage of data reductions is more unique to mosaic data though
some aspects are similar to combining any set of dithered exposures.  This
stage consists of combining of the multiple CCD images and multiple
exposures into a single image.  Since creating a single image from a single
mosaic exposure is of marginal value, the thrust of this stage of the
reductions is the combining of multiple exposures which have been spatially
offset or "dithered" to cover both the gaps between the individual CCDs and
any defects.

The steps required to produce a single deep integration from dithered
mosaic exposures consist of accurately registering the exposures, mosaicing
the multiple CCD images in each mosaic exposure into single images with the
same spatial sampling, correcting for variable sky gradients, measuring
changes in the intensity scale due to variations in transparency and sky
brightness, and combining the individual mosaiced images into a single deep
image with the gaps between the individual CCDs and any bad pixels
removed.

Some of the steps described here do not apply to all mosaic data.
These are removing instrumental artifacts from the controller, the
camera, and the telescope.  Specifically there is discussion of removing
amplifier crosstalk, pupil ghost reflections, and variable pixel scale
photometric effects.  These artifacts occur with the NOAO Mosaics
and telescopes and the discussion will be somewhat specific to this data,
though it may apply to other mosaic instruments and telescopes.  If your
data does not have there artifacts you can skip these steps.

4.1 Some Preliminaries

The command \fBsetinstrument\fR is used to set default parameters for the
tasks in the \fBmscred\fR package appropriate to a particular instrument.
Not all instruments will have instrument setup files.  When there are no
setup files you simply need to review and set the \fBmscred\fR package
and task parameters manually.  Note that the \fBesowfi\fR add-on package,
which provides an interface to the more generic \fBmscred\fR package,
has its own setup command, \fBesosetinst\fR.

Currently there are setup files for the NOAO Mosaics available through the
NOAO "mscdb" distribution which provides various runtime files such as
those used by \fBsetinstrument\fR as well as the calibration files for bad
pixels, crosstalk, and coordinate system, provided by the NOAO support
staff.

The \fBsetinstrument\fR command shuld only be run the first time you reduce
data.  Subsequently you should not do this since it will reset parameters
you may have later changed.

To set the parameters for reducing the NOAO Mosaic data type one of
the following command

nf
    ms> setinstrument ctio 4meter Mosaic2 review-
    ms> setinstrument kpno 4meter CCDMosaThin1 review-
    ms> setinstrument kpno 36inch CCDMosaThin1 review-
    ms> setinstrument kpno wiyn minimosaic review-
.fi

where the first argument is the observatory, the second is the telescope,
and the third is a camera name.  If the task is run without arguments
then you will be queried for each argument and a '?' may be entered to
get a list of available sites, telescopes, and instruments.

For some of the operations it is useful to specify lists of exposures
corresponding to a dither set.  The examples in this guide show using
@files for dither sets.  An @file is simply a list of filenames.  These can
be created in several ways including using a text editor.  One way is with
the \fBfiles\fR command to expand a file template.  For example,

.nf
    ms> files obj021,obj022,obj023,obj024,obj025 > field1
    ms> dir @field1
    obj021  obj002  obj003  obj004 obj005

4.2 Basic CCD Calibration

Basic CCD instrumental calibrations consist of correcting each CCD for
amplifier crosstalk, electronic bias levels, zero length exposure patterns,
dark counts, and pixel sensitivities.  A cosmetic replacement of bad pixels
may also be performed and saturated or non-linear pixels (determined from
the original pixel values before any corrections are applied) may be added
to a bad pixel mask.  When multiple amplifiers are used for each CCD the
extensions for amplifiers from the same CCD may be consolidated into a
single extension after the basic overscan bias correction is completed.

The task which provides all these operations is \fBccdproc\fR.  The
parameters of this task are shown below.

The parameter values are those set by \fBsetinstrument\fR for the NOAO
8K Mosaics.  The parameters for \fBccdproc\fR must be set before any
processing of the data takes place.  This is because the first actual
processing is the preparation of the calibration data using tasks that
combine sequences of zero level, dark count, and dome flat field
exposures.  The tasks that do these operations use \fBccdproc\fR.

The remainder of this sections briefly describes each of the operations
performed by \fBccdproc\fR in the order in which they occur.

This is recommended and is currently required to avoid problems at the
boundaries between the different amplifier images with the task that
resamples the mosaic data into a single image.

The location of bad pixels continues to be maintained in
the bad pixel masks and so this step is useful for display and to avoid
problems with tasks that don't use the bad pixel masks and may misbehave
unless the pixel values are reasonable.

Amplifier Crosstalk Removal

The CCD amplifiers in mosaic cameras are typically readout in
parallel.  It is possible that coupling in the controller electronics will
introduce crosstalk resulting in the pixel values produced by one amplifier
being affected by the signal in another amplifier.  There are many ways
this crosstalk may affect the data.  The mosaic reduction software
currently includes a way to correct or flag pixels based on a simple
crosstalk model.

In this model the signal for a pixel in one amplifier, which we
call the "source", adds or subtracts a small amount to the pixel value
read at the same time in another amplifier, called the "victim".  The
amount is either proportional to the source signal level or has a
threshold effect.  In the first case a correction can be obtained by
multiplying the pixel value of the source image by a crosstalk
coefficient and adding or subtracting from the matching pixel in the
victim image.  In the second case a source pixel value which is above
some level affects the victim pixel in some indeterminate way and
all that can be done is flag the pixel.  In this case it is assumed
that lower pixel values in the source do not affect the victim.

Note that it is possible that a source may also be a victim and that
a victim may be affected by multiple sources.  In this simple model
each pair of source and victim are treated independently and the source
pixel values used to correct a victim are treated as unaffected by
other amplifiers.  For small crosstalk coefficients this is may be
an acceptible approximation.

The crosstalk coefficients may be estimated using the task \fBxtcoeff\fR.
This requires having data with many stars per amplifier and levels up to
saturation.  There is a balance between having many bright stars but not so
many that most victim pixels matching bright stars in one amplifier will
also have stars affecting the pixel value.  In order to estimate the
crosstalk the ghosts of the bright stars should fall on pure sky.
Currently this task only works when the victim and source images have the
same readout order when match in image pixel coordinates.  This means that
if the data acquisition system flips different amplifiers into a standard
orientation on the sky when writing the values to the image extensions then
the victim and source images must come from the same CCD amplifiers.  This
means the task currently only works for the NOAO 8K mosaics read with one
amplifier per CCD.

The NOAO 8K mosaics have crosstalk that is clearly visible as ghosts
of bright stars from one amplifier appearing in one or more other
amplifiers.  The electronic basis of this crosstalk is not currently
understood.  The simple model described above removes the ghosts
and appears to be a satisfactory solution.  The instrument support
scientists recommend using this crosstalk removal method with crosstalk
coefficient files they supply.  While the crosstalk correction software
has recently incorporated the possiblity of flagging the pixels this
has not yet been added to the data reduction path described here.

The WIYN MiniMosaic uses modified versions of the same controllers as
the 8K mosaics.  However, at this time it appears the nature of the
crosstalk is more in the second case of a threshold effect.  This is
compounded by the fact that the gain is such that high signal levels
are lost in digital saturation.

The crosstalk model described here is implemented by the \fBmscred\fR
task \fBxtalkcor\fR.  It may be used directly before running \fBccdproc\fR or
by setting the "xtalkcor" parameter in \fBccdproc\fR to yes.  The
crosstalk coefficient file is specified by the "xtalkfile" parameter.
The NOAO mosaic data acquisition systems include the keyword XTALKFIL
in the data headers with the recommended crosstalk calibration file
from the mscdb calibration directory.  So to use the recommended
file set the "xtalkfile" parameter to "!xtalkfil" which references
the file given by the keyword.

If you have some data with bright stars in each amplifier you can try
and measure the crosstalk coefficients yourself with the task \fBxtcoeff\fR.
For NOAO 8-channel and 16-channel data use

.nf
ms> xtcoeff [images] myxtalkfile @vnoao8 @snoao8 interactive+
ms> xtcoeff [images] myxtalkfile @vnoao16 @snoao16 interactive+
.fi

respectively.  The @files include all the pairs of amplifiers which
affect each other.  In the interactive mode for each pair of amplifiers
graphs of coefficient estimates for pairs of pixels in which the source
is greater than 20000 ADU are plotted as a function of source ADU.
The constant fit is the crosstalk coefficient estimate.  In the interactive
plots use the 's' key to set regions to include in the fit and the
't' key is used to clear the sample.  The purpose of this is to avoid
source pixels which contaminate victim pixels that already have an object
leading.  For more information read the help for the task.

.sh
Bad Pixel Interpolation and Saturation Flagging

Bad pixels are identified by non-zero integer values in a bad pixel mask.
There is a separate bad pixel mask for each CCD.  When there are multiple
amplifiers per CCD there need only be one mask covering the whole CCD
since the portion of the mask covering each amplifier image can be
determined from coordinate information in the headers.  The mask for
each extension is specified through the BPM keyword in the header.

Because the bad pixel masks provide a record of where the bad pixels
are and the values of the pixels are not scientifically useful, the values
of those pixels can be changed for cosmetic purposes and to provide
benign values for tasks which don't use the masks and might otherwise
misbehave.  

The "fixpix" option in \fBccdproc\fR replaces the bad pixels, where
the bad pixel masks are specified by the "fixfile" parameter with
the value "BPM", by interpolation.  Note that this is done on the
input pixel values and not the output.  Typically the bad pixel
masks applied at this point are maps of the non-linear pixels in
the CCDs.  These are the same for all exposures.  For the NOAO
mosaics BPM keywords point to standard calibration masks.

The fixpix/fixfile parameters define input masks.  \fBCcdproc\fR can also
produce output pixel masks which merge the input masks with saturated
pixels added.  Obviously each exposure will produce its own masks.  The
masks are produced if a bad pixel mask name for each processed exposure is
specified with the "bpmasks" parameter.  Currently subdirectories with the
specified name are created into which the individual masks for each
extension are written.  The BPM keyword in the processed data are
reset to the new masks.

Saturated pixels must be identified in the raw counts before any
other calibration, though the crosstalk correction may occur first
but this only makes small changes to the values.  .......

Electronic Bias Removal and Overscan Trimming

Electronic bias removal is a standard CCD reduction step where overscan
data is used to estimate the electron bias level.  To include this step set
the "overscan" parameter to yes and define the overscan bias region with
the "biassec" parameter.  NOAO mosaic data includes the bias region
appropriate for each amplifier image in the header keyword BIASSEC.  To
reference this keyword value  set the parameter to  "!biassec".

The set of parameters from "interactive" to "grow" define how the
overscan region is used to estimate the bias level at each line.  This
is described in the help for this task.

After the bias is estimated and removed the overscan region is no longer
needed and it is removed by trimming the image to only the actual CCD
data.  The trimming can also be used to remove border pixels which might
be bad.  The region to be kept after trimming is specified with the
"trimsec" parameter.  NOAO mosaic data also includes the trim region
in a keyword called TRIMSEC.  To reference this keyword value set
the parameter to "!trimsec".

Note that in order to merge multiple amplifier readouts from the same
CCD the data must be trimmed.

.sh
4.2.2  Preparing Calibration Data

This section describes how to prepare the basic calibration data.  The
steps are virtually the same as with the \fBccdred\fR package and, in fact,
the command names and parameters are the same.  The basic calibration data
of zero level, dark count, and dome flat fields are generally taken as a
sequence of identical exposures which are combined to minimize the noise.
Later sections discuss correcting the flat fields for pupil ghost reflections
and preparing a sky flat field calibration using the
object exposures.

The calibration exposures are individually reduced by \fBccdproc\fR and
then combined.  Thus, it is necessary to first set the \fBccdproc\fR
parameters.  Because this task knows which operations are appropriate for
particular types of calibration exposures you can set all the parameters
for object exposures.  Below is a typical set of parameters.  The main
optional setting is whether or not to replace bad pixels by interpolation,
which is purely a cosmetic correction.  However, it is recommended that
this be done to avoid possible arithmetic problems in the processing.

The overscan correction has two methods as selected by the fitting function.
A value of "legendre" (or "chebyshev" or "spline3") take all the overscan data
and fit a smooth function along the column direction.  The "order" value
of 1 shown above fits a single constant value.  This leaves to the zero
level calibration to subtract any details of line-by-line structure.  A value
of "mean", "median", or "minmax" take the mean, median, or mean excluding
the minimum and maximum values, of the overscan at each line and subtract
that value from that line.  The other fitting parameters are ignored.
The advantage of this is that systematic line-by-line patterns are
subtracted.  The disadvantage is, since the sample of overscan pixels
is small at each line, that this can also introduce a statistical line-by-line
pattern.  There is currently no recommendation for the NOAO Mosaic.

The first step is generally to process and combine sequences of zero, dark,
and dome flat exposures.  This is done using the tasks \fBzerocombine\fR,
\fBdarkcombine\fR, and \fBflatcombine\fR.  The combining must be done in
the following order since the processing of later calibration data requires
the preceding calibration data.

.nf
    ms> zerocombine *.fits
    ms> darkcombine *.fits
    ms> flatcombine *.fits
.fi

Each of these tasks search all the exposures for a particular type so it is
fine to specify all files, though if the file names code the type, such as
"dflatNNN", then one can use that as the wildcard to shorten the search of
all the data.  Also \fBflatcombine\fR has the feature that it will combine
the data separately for each filter.  However, you can use explicit file
lists, templates, or @files to limit the input files.  The output combined
names have standard default values which the above settings for
\fBccdproc\fR use.

It is a good idea to first check that the different calibration types
and filters are correctly identified by the software.  This is done
using the \fBccdlist\fR command

.nf
    ms> ccdlist *.fits
.fi

Unless you change the parameters "mscred.backup" and
"mscred.bkuproot" the original raw files will be saved in the
subdirectory "Raw/".  If you want to start over, delete the processed files
and copy the raw files back to the working directory.  If disk space is a
concern and you are satisfied with the combined calibration files you can
delete the individual processed calibration files.  There is a parameter in
the combining tasks that will delete the individual files automatically
after processing and combining.

.sh
4.2.3 Pupil Image Removal from Flat Fields

----
At the Mayall telescope there are reflections off the corrector that
produce a visible image of the pupil.  Coating of the corrector minimizes
this image but it may be desirable to remove this instrumental signature
which would otherwise cause a small variation of the photometric zero
point as well as an unwanted visible feature.  There are two sections
discussing removal of this feature from the flat field data and from
the object exposures.  If your data is from the KPNO 0.9 meter telescope
or the image is faint enough that it is not of concern then you can
skip the extended discussion.
----

----
For the Mayall telescope the pupil image due to reflections off the
corrector must be removed from the flat field and object exposures.
An additional calibration is required to correct for the variable pixel
scale across the field of view if you intend to do photometry on the
individual CCD images.
----

NOAO Mosaic data taken at the Mayall (4meter) telescope include a pupil
image caused by reflections off the corrector.  The magnitude of this image
is a function of the filter and the state of the anti-reflection coatings
on the corrector.  It is also a function of the total light, including
from outside the field of view, and somewhat on the location of bright
stars.

It might appear at first that one simply divides the object exposures by
the flat field as is done for the OTF display calibration.  However this is
not photometrically correct because the pupil image is an additive light
effect and not a detector response.  Instead the pupil image must first
be removed from the flat field before applying it to the object data.
The object data is then corrected after flat fielding by subtracting the
extra light from the pupil image.

The pupil image is removed from the flat field by dividing by an estimate
of the pupil image pattern.  The challenge is to determine the pupil image
contribution in the presence of other flat field structure.

There are two current approaches to obtaining the pupil image pattern for
removal from the data.  One is to use data from another source where the
pupil pattern is more easily separated from the flat field pattern.  The
second is to derive the pattern from the data assuming something about the
form of the pattern.  In particular, to use the difference in scales
between the larger pupil pattern and the smaller flat field pattern.
The first approach is preferable since it better preserves fine structure
in the pupil image but the second is needed when no other data is available.

.sh
4.2.3.1 Broadband Data

For broadband data the recommended procedure is to obtain a narrowband
flat field exposure.  This narrowband exposure will have a stronger pupil
image relative to the flat field pattern and, when the pupil image
is scaled down to match the broadband image flat field, the errors from
the flat field response will be diminished.

The pupil image is extracted from the narrowband flat field using the task
\fBmscpupil\fR.  This task determines the background levels in a ring
inside and outside the main pupil image and subtracts this background to
produced the pupil image template.  Outside the outer background ring the
template is set to zero.  In effect this is like "scrapping off" the pupil
image from the exposure.

The output type is set to "data" to extract the pupil image after
background subtraction.  The pattern center parameters are offsets from the
astrometric center and the inner and outer radii are measured from the
pattern center.  The default values are for the last measured Mayall
pupil image.  The fitting parameters marked with an asterisk are not
used when extracting the pupil image directly.

The pupil image template is scaled and removed from the flat field using the
task \fBrmpupil\fR.  The removal is done with the arithmetic
operation

.nf
	I(out) = I(in) / (scale * I(template) + 1)

The "input" is the broadband flat field, the "output" is the corrected flat
field, and the "template" is the narrowband pupil image produced by
\fBmscpupil\fR.  The type of removal for a flat field is "ratio" as given
by the equation above.

Determining the optimal scaling of the template pupil image to the input
pupil image is normally done interactively.  The task makes a guess at
scaling.  If this task is used non-interactively this will be the scale
used.  When the task is used interactively the input and corrected mosaic
exposures are displayed and then a query for a new scale is given.  By
repeatedly adjusting the scale factor the best visual removal can be
obtained.  When done the output corrected flat field is created using the
last specified scale factor.  Note that to quit requires entering dummy
special values for the scale factor.  A value of zero means to create the
final output exposure with the last scale factor and a value of -1 means to
quit without producing any output.

Because this operation is fairly slow and iterative there are some steps
that can be taken to it speed up.  The "extname" parameter selects just
those extensions to look at.  For NOAO Mosaic data the default selects the
central four extensions covered by the pupil image.  The "blkavg" parameter
applies a block average to the input exposure and template.  This makes the
display and iterative corrections faster.  When the best scale factor has
been determined the entire input image at full resolution is corrected by
the full resolution template to create the output flat field.  If one wants
to use the facilities of \fBmscexam\fR to evaluate each iterative
correction then the "mscexam" parameter can be set.  However, the most
powerful estimate for the optimal scale factor is viewing the display and
possibly blinking between the uncorrected and corrected frames.

.fi

Note that this only differs from the previously shown parameters by
setting the "type" parameter to ratio.  Because the template is
derived from the data itself there is no need to use \fBrmpupil\fR
to iteratively determine a scale factor.  The "output" parameter is
the corrected flat field.

The corrected narrowband flat field will show some artifacts from fine
structure in the pupil image.  However, a large fraction of the pupil image
will be removed.  Later reduction steps of applying a sky flat field and
combining with dithering further eliminate effects of this approximate
solution to the pupil image.

.sh
4.2.4 Object Exposure Reductions

At this point you will have some subset of combined zero level, dark count,
and flat field calibration data.  The calibration data is applied to
the object exposures, either in bulk or as observations are completed,
using the task \fBccdproc\fR.  The command is simply

.nf
    ms> ccdproc <files>
.fi

.sh
4.2.5 Pupil Image Removal from Object Data

The pupil ring image in the object exposures is removed by subtraction
since this is excess light.   Again this is only required for data where
the pupil image occurs, such as from the Mayall telescope.  The tasks for
modeling and removing the image are the same as for removal from the flat
field except that the "type" parameter is set to "difference".

.sh
4.2.5.1 Broadband Data

Probably the best subtraction will be obtained by using the pupil image
template from a narrowband flat field.  This would be the same as used
for the flat field and extracted from the narrowband flat field using
\fBmscpupil\fR with "type = data".  The subtraction is carried out using
\fBrmpupil\fR with "type = difference".

An alternative, since the pupil image is weak and the fine structure is
unimportant, is to use \fBmscpupil\fR with "type = difference" to determine
a smooth large scale ring pattern and subtract it from the data.  The
iterative sigma rejection and the "datamin" and "datamax" parameters are
used to eliminate smaller scale astronomical objects in the field from
affecting the background fits and the ring profile fits.  For this
application the "abin" parameter should be set to a value such as 30
degrees and the "astep" parameter to a smaller value such as 5 degrees.

The main advantage of this method is that no iterative scaling is required
since the fit is done directly to the data.  The difficulty, though,
is if there is a bright star or fairly extended object, particularly
in the inner background ring, then the fit will be poor and the subtraction
will show gross artifacts.

The last alternative, and the one to use if there is no narrowband flat
field for the template and the field has bright stars which affect fitting
directly to the data, is to make a "sky flat" to generate the pupil image
template.  This is done as described in the section for creating a sky
flat.  Once the sky flat is created with the pupil image then
\fBmscpupil\fR is used to separate the pupil image from the background and
\fBrmpupil\fR is used to scale and subtract the image from the object
exposures.  Note that after the pupil image is subtracted then a new
sky flat should be created.

.sh
4.2.5.2 Narrowband Data

For narrowband data the two alternatives described for the broadband data
are used.  The first is to fit and subtract a smooth ring model from each
object exposure using \fBmscpupil\fR.  This is the same as described
for removing the pupil image from the flat field except the "type"
parameter is set to difference.  The second is to create a sky flat
from disregistered exposures, extract the pupil pattern with
\fBmscpupil\fR, and then subtract it from each object exposure using
\fBrmpupil\fR.

.sh
4.2.6 Dark Sky or Twilight Sky Flat Fields

You will notice that there are two flat field corrections which can be
performed by \fBccdproc\fR.  The first one is for an initial flat field
such as the dome flat obtained at the beginning of the night, a standard
flat field from a previous night or run, or a final combined dome flat and
sky flat from some other night or run.  The second is for a dark sky or
twilight sky flat field prepared from the object exposures after they have
been calibrated with the first flat field.

Sky flat fields are created by combining object exposures with objects
removed by using data in each pixel that is only sky.  In principle one
could use exposures of the twilight sky but our experience is that these do
not work well.  You are welcome to take some exposures and try using them.
We have found that dark sky flat fields derived from the object exposures
do work quite well.

Mosaic observations already typically dither a field.  One will do even
better by combining observations from other fields.  The more data used the
better the resulting sky flat will be. The main criterion for including
data is to avoid observations contaminated by varying background light from
the moon or scattered light from bright stars off the field.  Of course,
another factor that has to be considered is whether a field has a very
large extended object which appears in many of the observations.  These
will not be useful.

The sky flat field is created using the task \fBsflatcombine\fR with
parameters selected to reject objects appearing above a median.  We don't
have much experience with creating sky flats currently so some
experimentation with parameters may be required.  Below is one possibly
set of parameters.

    (blank  =         1.) Value if there are no pixels
    (grow   =         3.) Radius (pixels) for neighbor rejection
.fi

This task is a combination of \fBccdproc\fR to first process the images, if
they have not previously been processed, and \fBcombine\fR to combine the
offset images with rejection of object pixels.  A new feature of this
task is the "grow" parameter which now provides a two dimensional
circular rejection of pixels around pixels rejected by the rejection
algorithm.  Whatever rejection algorithm is used it is likely that
the best results will be when the clipping sigmas are non-symmetric as
shown above.  Note that a very low rejection threshold or very large grow
radius will make the task quite slow.

After producing a good sky flat that has no evidence of objects it may
be applied directly to the data by using it as the second flat field
correction.

.nf
    ms> ccdproc <files> sflatcor=yes sflat=Sflat*
.fi

Note that the object exposures used in creating the sky flat will already
have been processed except for the application of the sky flat so
\fBccdproc\fR will only apply the sky flat field calibration.

The sky flat field includes corrections at all scales from pixel-to-pixel
sensitivity variations to large scale illumination differences.  If the
signal-to-noise is poorer than the dome flat field you might wish to apply
a filtering/smoothing operation to the sky flat data thus relying on the
dome flat field for the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity calibration and the sky
flat field for larger scale illumination corrections.  There are a number
of filtering tasks in IRAF.  A median is a good filter and there is the
choice of a ring median or box median.  To apply one of these general
filtering tasks you would use \fBmsccmd\fR to run it on all the CCDs

.nf
    ms> msccmd
    msccmd: median $input $output 10 10
    Input files: SflatV
    Output files: SflatMedV
    msccmd: q
.fi

Because the object exposures are first processed with the dome flat (or
other flat field) you would normally run \fBccdproc\fR again on the data
using the sky flat and any observations that have not been processed at all
will use both the dome flat and the sky flat.  However, if you want to make
a single flat field to apply to raw data, say if starting over or using it
for a second night, you can combine the two flat field corrections into a
single flat field to be used as the only flat field correction.  This is
done by multiplying the two flat fields using \fBmscarith\fR

.nf
    ms> mscarith FlatV * SflatV FinalflatV
.fi

.sh
4.2.7 The Variable Pixel Scale and Zero Point Uniformity

----
Another step of the basic CCD calibration stage which has generally been
ignored or forgotten with smaller single CCD formats is the variable pixel
scale.  The large field of view provided by a mosaic and the optics
required to provide it can lead to a significant variation in the pixel
scale.  This effect is important with the Mayall telescope and is also
present in the NOAO 0.9 meter data to a smaller degree.  It is likely to be
present in other telescopes as well.

When the pixel scale varies significantly the standard flat field
calibration operation will cause the photometric zero point to vary.  A
simple calibration step can be performed to remove this effect.  However,
if you intend to produce single images from the mosaic of CCDs this step is
not necessary since the resampling operation naturally accounts for this
effect.
----

A key assumption in the traditional reduction of CCD images is that the
pixel scale is uniform and that a properly reduced blank sky image will
have a uniform and flat appearance.  Unfortunately, this is not correct
when the pixel scale varies over the field.  In the case of the NOAO Mosaic
at the Mayall telescope, the pixel scale decreases approximately
quadratically from the field center, with the pixels in the field corners
being 6% smaller in the radial direction, and 8% smaller in area.  Pixels
in field corners thus would properly detect only 92% of the sky level seen
in the field center, even with uniform sensitivity.  At the same time the
same number of \fItotal\fR photons would be detected from a star regardless
of how many pixels the PSF would be distributed over.  Forcing the sky to
be uniform over the image has the deleterious effect of causing the
photometric zeropoint to vary from center to field corners by 8%.  Note
that this effect is different from vignetting where the flux actually
delivered to the image margins is less than that at the center, an effect
that \fIis\fR corrected by the flat field.

In practice, the photometric effect of the variable pixel scale can be
ignored provided that the reduced images will be part of a dither-sequence
to be stacked later on.  As discussed below, prior to stacking the images
they first must be re-gridded, which produces pixels of essentially
constant angular scale.  This is done with the \fBmscimage\fR task, which
re-grids the pixels and has a "flux conservation" option that can scale the
pixels photometrically by the associated area change.  If this function is
disabled, then "improperly" flattened images will have a uniform zero point
restored.  In short, the flat field adjusted (if inappropriately) for the
different pixel sizes, so \fBmscimage\fR would then do no further
adjustment.  Stars would be too bright in the corners of the flattened
images, but after re-gridding, their total fluxes would be seen to be
scaled down to the appropriate values.

If the mosaic CCD images are to be analyzed individually, as might be done
for standard star fields, then after the flat field reductions are complete
the differential scale effects must be restored.  At present we are
developing a routine in the \fBmscred\fR package to do this, without
actually re-gridding the image.  The correction process is simple; the
scale at any point in the Mosaic field is already known from the astrometry
so one just calculates and multiplies by the correction.  The final image
would appear to have a variable sky level, but would be photometrically
uniform.

.sh
4.3 Coordinate Calibration

For some projects the basic flux calibrated CCD exposures may be all that
is required.  However, if you want to obtain coordinate information or
combine multiple exposures which are dithered on the sky or taken with
different filters, you must calibrate the celestial world coordinate
system (WCS) of the data.  This may be done in an absolute or relative
sense; an absolute calibration ties the data coordinates to catalog
coordinates while a relative calibration ties multiple exposures to the
same coordinates.

Determining the WCS from scratch is a complicated business and requires
special observations of astrometry fields.  However, for NOAO Mosaic data a
standard coordinate calibration determined earlier is automatically
inserted into your data by the data capture agent.  The default coordinate
system is sufficiently accurate for most purposes and just requires some
small adjustments as described below.  To piece a single exposure into a
single image that does not require registration to any other data you may
use the default WCS and skip the WCS calibration steps.

[Need discussion of using MSCSETWCS to set WCS from a database]

.sh
4.3.1 Creating or Updating a Mosaic World Coordinate System 

This section describe how to create or update a world coordinate system
(WCS) for mosaic data using IRAF and \fBmscred\fR tools.  A version of this
discussion which includes example pictures may be found at
http://iraf.noao.edu/projects/ccdmosaic/astrometry/astrom.html.

A WCS is
the header description that relates the image pixels to equatorial
celestial coordinates.  For a mosaic each extension requires its own WCS to
account for the relative orientations of the CCDs as well as for the
optical distortions from the focal plane to the sky.  The unifying aspect
of a mosaic WCS is that in all extensions the WCS uses the same reference
point on the sky.  This is normally the optical axis of the telescope and
also the approximate center of the mosaic detector.
The WCS for different exposures are
generally the same (excluding binning and subraster readouts) except for
the celestial coordinate tied to the reference point.

While it is possible to derive the WCS without having any
header information it helps considerably to be able to use \fBmscdisplay\fR
and \fBccdproc\fR.  In this discussion we assume that the headers
contain the information needed to display and process the mosaic
exposures.  A description of how to set up this information is given
in http://iraf.noao.edu/projects/ccdmosaic/generic/generic.html.

In principle one would want to derive WCS for each filter.
This has been done to some extent for the NOAO mosaic imagers.
The data acquisition system then adds the WCS for the appropriate
filter and telescope.
However, there is a stage in the mosaic data reduction where the WCS
is adjusted to account for zeropoint offsets, small rotations, and
refraction effects and scale changes.  This is done by
registering the WCS to a set of coordinates, either relative to one
exposure or from a catalog of star coordinates.  This registration
provides the small adjustments to match filters to the same coordinate
system.

.sh
4.3.1.1 Input Data

To begin you need a calibration exposure of a field with many astrometric
stars per CCD.  Astrometric stars are those for which you can obtain
accurate right ascension and declination in J2000 coordinates and epoch of
observation (i.e. proper motion corrected coordinates).  Of course you can
use less accurate coordinates and then the WCS will be less accurate.  In
the example the calibration exposure is of USNO standard field K.  The
coordinates from the USNO-A2 catalog were obtain from
http://www.noao.edu/gateway/catalogs/usno.html.  Another source of USNO
coordinates is http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/cadcbin/getusno2.  For the KPNO
Mosaic star clusters with published astrometric coordinates were used.
[Refer to MSCGETCATALOG]

The required coordinate list is a simple text file of RA in hours and
Dec in degrees.  The IRAF routines allow values to be input in sexigesimal
notation as well as in decimal format.  Only the first two columns are
required but the remaining columns, for USNO coordinates the red and blue
magnitudes, are useful for creating subsets of stars such as by magnitude
and for identification.

To prepare the astrometric calibration data process it to subtract bias and
trim to just the CCD data, that is trim away any prescan and overscan.
Zero level, dark count, and flat fielding are generally not necssary for
fields which have relatively bright stars.

.sh
4.3.1.2 Creating a WCS From Scratch

This section describes creating an initial, rough, WCS for data which
does not have a starting one.  It is much easier to update a prior
WCS than it is to begin without one.  If your data has even a crude
WCS or one that needs to be updated, either because the mosaic
detector was worked on in a way that might have moved the CCDs or because
you want to redo and possibly improve the current WCS, then you can
skip this section and go to section "4.3.1.3 Updating the WCS".

To get an initial WCS requires you to create a text file for each CCD
having lines with pixel coordinates (X and Y) and matching celestial
coordinates (RA and Dec).  There must be at least three coordinate pairs,
usually the pixel position and celestial coordinates of stars, in the
image.  A finder chart is clearly useful for this.  Making the text file
can be accomplished in various ways including just using a text file
editor.

The tools you need are an image display, such as XIMTOOL, and some way
to get the image pixel coordinates using the cursor.  This might be as
simple as looking at the coordinate readout box in the display, or use
tasks such as RIMCURSOR or IMEXAMINE.  While centroided positions can be
used it is not really necessary for the determining an initial WCS.  The
initial WCS will be refined later using centroiding and more coordinates.
The pixel coordinates can be recorded directly to a file or edited by
hand.  Similarly the celestial coordinates can be added after the pixel
coordinates are determined or as the pixel coordinates are measured.

Here we illustrate using \fBrimcursor\fR.  This task is simply a cursor
reading loop that writes the keystrokes typed in the display to the
standard output, which can be redirected to a file.  First display a
particular CCD (or single amplifier readout) with \fBdisplay\fR (not
\fBmscdisplay\fR which is for displaying all the CCDs) using the "fill"
option.  Remember to specify the image extension. Then run \fBrimcursor\fR
with the output directed to a file.  When you have matched an object in the
image with an RA and Dec in your finding chart and list, position the
cursor on the object and type colon followed by the RA and Dec.

Below is an example of the output generated in this way.
One could edit the file
to remove the "101 :" but in the next step we have the option of specifying
which columns are used.

.nf
    ms> type example1.dat

    1188.444 2412.452 101 : 15:23:54 -0:15:22
.fi

The task that computes a WCS is \fBccmap\fR.  This task is basically a
fitting task that fits a transformation between pixel coordinates and
celestial coordinates and records the result in both a database file and in
the image header as a WCS.  This task could be used directly to make a
final WCS if the the input is generated with many centroided stars and
celestial coordinates.  This is discussed further in "4.1.3.5 CCMAP Verses
MSCTPEAK and Logical Verses Physical Coordinates".

Below shows the result of using this task with the example of three
stars.  Note that we need to change the "lngcol" and "latcol" parameters.
We use an output database of "dev$null" since for now we only want to
update the header.  In the interactive fitting you just need to type 'q'.
Later you will do more with this interactive fitting mode.  You could also
turn off the interactive fitting if desired.  Another possiblity for doing
multiple fitts in one step is to use a list of images (again given with the
extension syntax) and a matching list of files with the coordinates.

4.3.1.3 Updating the WCS

Starting with an approximately correct WCS what is done is to register
a list of celestial coordinates to the objects in the image, fit a WCS of
an appropriate order to describe the optical distortions, and update the
header and write a WCS database file to be used to apply the WCS to other
images.  This is done separately for each CCD though the WCS are
constrained to have the same celestial reference point as noted earlier.
This requires that there are RA and Dec keywords in the header (in hours
and degrees respectively) for each extension which are the same and which
point to the optical center of the exposure.  The keywords may be added if
not present with
\fBhedit\fR.

The task we will use is MSCTPEAK in the MSCFINDER subpackage of
MSCRED.  This task was derived from an older program,
TFINDER, for
making plate solutions using the Guide Star Catalog.  The MSCFINDER version
instead accepts any simple text file of RA and Dec coordinates, understands
the multiextension format, and produces a database appropriate for
application to other mosaic exposures.  There is currently no specific help
for this task but it is fairly self-guiding and the help for TFINDER can be
used as a reference.

The single list of coordinates includes all objects within the field of the
entire mosaic and may contain objects outside the field.  The task will use
the starting WCS to select those stars in or near each element of the mosaic
for display and for you to register to the image.  The example list, part
of which is shown below, is taken from the USNO catalog.  As before only the
first two columns are used and other columns may be present for other
purposes.  In this case the list has been previously sorted by red
magnitude though the order does not matter for MSCTPEAK.

.fi

Now we look at the parameters for MSCTPEAK that will update the WCS for
our example.  The "extname" parameter can be used to work only on one or a
subset of extensions.  Otherwise if you abort the task or the task crashes
you would need to go through all the extensions again.  The "projection" in
the example is "tnx" which is a tangent plane projection with distortion
polynomials that is understood by IRAF tasks.  The orders are for terms up
to a power of three.  This is needed for the NOAO 4meter telescopes.  You
should use "tan" if that is sufficient for your telescope distortions
otherwise use the lowest representation you can.  In future other functions
might be used and will incorporate the developing FITS WCS standards.  You
will notice that there are some parameters you saw with CCMAP.  That is
because the fitting engine in this task is also CCMAP.

    (mode   =           q)
.fi

Now run the task.  You must have an image display tool running.  The
task will display, with the "fill" option, each image extension in turn.
We will only look at the first extension in this example.  It will draw
circles where the current WCS predicts the objects to be.  If you see no
circles when you expect to then there is a problem with the WCS.  This
might be due to not having the CRVALn keywords correct for the field or the
initial WCS is not correct.  The example below shows the first part of running
the example.  Figure 8 shows the cursor help and figure 9 shows a
zoomed portion of the display.

You will be prompted with the image cursor for input of various
commands.  The '?' command will page a list of the commands.

The important keys are 'a', 'f', 'k', 'l', and 'r'.  We could attempt
to center all objects using one object with the 'a'+'k' command.  But
because of the rotation and rough nature of the initial WCS only
stars in the vicinity of the reference object would be correctly centered.
Instead we move around the field typing 'k' on the image of some of the
stars from which we will do a first WCS fit.  Note that the 'k' key
will center the nearest red circle.  If there is a possiblity of confusion
the 'l' key is used by typing 'l' on the red circle and then 'l' again
on the object to be centered.

When moving around the field feel free to zoom the display.
You should center a few stars in the corners and the edge, roughly
12 stars.  The centered stars are shown in blue.  Because the circles
can't be erased except by reloading the image the red circles for the
centered objects are still visible.

Once some stars have been centered type 'f' to fit a new WCS.
This will bring up the interactive graphical fitting of CCMAP.  You can type
'?' to get a reminder of the keys that can be used.  The initial
figure is something like an x,y plot of the positions to show the
distribution of the objects to be fit.  Most of the work is done by
using the 'x', 'y', 'r', and 's' to display residuals as a function of
x and y.  In these plots you might use 'd' to delete misidentified,
miscentered, or stars with large and uncorrected proper motions.
After deleting stars type 'f' to redo the fit.  For the first
pass don't worry too much about the details.  We will come back to
the fit after adding in the rest of the objects.  Type 'q' to go
back to the image.

Type 'r' to redisplay the image with the circles now at the position
of the new WCS.  You can now center all the objects quickly
with 'a'+'k' on a star which has a blue circle, this centers without any
initial offset.  After this you will find most of the red cicles are
blue and correctly centered on an object.  In some cases the centering
may fail and the circle remains red.  Also if you have wrong centering
you can delete a source with 'd'.  Once most of the stars have been
recentered you are ready to get the final WCS solution.  Type 'f' again.

After quitting the final fit and returning to the image displays type
'q' to quit the current extension and go on to the next one.  When this is
done the image header is updated and a database record is written.

The final database record will look something like what is shown below.
The database record name will be the same as the extension
name.

4.3.1.4 Applying a WCS Database to Other Exposures

The end result of creating and updating a WCS is that the calibration
image will have the right WCS in its header and a database file will be
produced.  To apply the WCS database to other images requires two things.
First the WCS keywords must be added to the image extensions based on the
extension names.  Second the position of the reference point in the WCS,
the CRVALn keywords, must be set to the right point on the sky.  The task
MSCSETWCS, whose parameters are shown in figure 14,  does this.

.nf
                           I R A F  
            Image Reduction and Analysis Facility
PACKAGE = mscred
   TASK = mscsetwcs

images  =     newimage  Mosaic images
database=   example.db  WCS database
(ra     =           ra) Right ascension keyword (hours)
(dec    =          dec) Declination keyword (degrees)
(equinox=      equinox) Epoch keyword (years)
(ra_offs=           0.) RA offset (arcsec)
(dec_off=           0.) Dec offset (arcsec)
(extlist=             )
.fi

The first thing the task does is apply the WCS database specified by
the "database" parameter.  If no database is specified then this task can
be used only for the second step of updating the WCS reference coordinate
based on the coordinate keywords in the header.  This step consists of
transforming the keywords specified by the "ra" and "dec" parameters,
presumably set by the data acquisition system, to the WCS keywords "crval1"
and "crval2".  The keywords give the RA and Dec of the observation in hours
and degrees.  Ideally these fairly obvious keywords will be a pointing put
into the data by the data acquisition system based on the telescope
pointing.  The "equinox" keyword, if specified and found in the header,
will precess the header coordinates to the equinox of the J2000 equinox of
the WCS.  The offset parameters may be used if there is always a known
offset between the RA and Dec values in the header and the WCS reference
point.

Currently this task and the method of updating the WCS from a database
assumes that there is no rotation or only a small
rotation between the WCS calibration and later observations.  The
small rotations, as well as scale and atmospheric refraction effects
are removed later as a global adjustment to the WCS using the task
MSCCMATCH.

.sh
4.3.1.5 CCMAP Verses MSCTPEAK and Logical Verses Physical Coordinates

MSCTPEAK is a convenient routine.  However you can also do everything
with other tools which produce the input to CCMAP, the list of accurate
pixel and celestial coordinates, and then use CCDMAP directly.  The
important points to note in the context of a mosaic and  MSCRED is that the
"pixsystem" should be specified as "physical" and the database WCS names
should be just the image extension names.  This is needed to allow
MSCSETWCS, see "4.3.1.4 Applying a WCS Database to Other
Exposures", to update the headers of mosaic exposures which have a
different pointing and possibly are untrimmed (have overscan and prescan
regions), trimmed to a smaller region, binned, or the result of a subregion
readout.

The idea is that the WCS database describes a transformation between
"physical" coordinates and celestial coordinates.  Physical coordinates are
coordinates tied to some fundamental system.  For mosaic data this should
be the unbinned CCD coordinates.  The "logical" coordinate system is the
pixel coordinates of the actual image raster.  By determining the WCS and
specifying the database WCS in physical coordinates, then when the WCS is
applied to other exposures first the logical pixels of the exposure are
transformed to the same physical system (unbinned CCD pixels) regardless of
overscan/prescan regions, binning, and subraster readouts.  Another way to
think of this is that the WCS database in physical coordinates is a WCS
tied to the CCD pixels.  The transformation between logical and physical
coordinates is specified by the LTV and LTM keywords found in the image
headers.

Earlier we recommended that that the calibration exposure be trimmed to
the full unbinned CCD data.  This means that the headers should all have
LTM1_1/LTM2_2 = 1 and LTV1/LTV2 missing or zero.  CCDPROC will update or
create  these keywords based on the CCDSEC and NSUM keywords.  However, the
database WCS is best applied as early as possible in the raw data.  If
the data have been binned then LTM1_1/LTM2_2 will be different than one and
if there is an overscan on the left of the image, say 64 pixels of
overscan, then the raw data should have LTV1=-64.  MSCSETWCS will then
apply the WCS correctly in this case.

.sh
4.3.1.6 Verifying a WCS

During any operation involving the WCS it is useful to be able to
see if the coordinate system is correct.  A picture is worth a thosand
words and can help you diagnose problems.  The tasks MSCZERO and MSCTVMARK
are useful for this.  You need to have a list of coordinates that you
expect to overlay on your field.  This might be easily obtained from
some catalog such as the USNO-A.  Then you display the image either
with MSCDISPLAY or MSCZERO.  The latter does MSCDISPLAY if the image
is not already loaded and enters an interactive cursor loop.  Then
you would use MSCTVMARK or the 'm' key in MSCZERO which excutes this
task.  This takes the celestial coordinates, determines in which, if any,
of the extensions the star falls based on the WCS and draws marks
at the appropriate logical pixel coordinate.

.sh
4.3.2 Global adjustments to an exisiting Mosaic World Coordinate System

The WCS is a mapping from pixels in the mosaic data to celestial
coordinates relative to a reference point on the sky.  The reference point,
or zero point, is set using the telescope pointing coordinate.  The
telescope pointing is generally off by a small amount, though it could be
completely wrong in some hardware/software error situations.  In addition,
differential atmospheric refraction introduces small axis scale changes and
rotations, which are significant due to the large field of view of the
mosaic even during the course of single set of dithered exposured.
Putting observations from different filters onto the same coordinate system
also requires mapping small scale changes, since currently there is only a
single standard WCS solution derived through one filter.  [In the future
filter dependent solutions will be made available.]

The WCS calibration operations consist of adjusting the standard coordinate
system calibration to a desired zero point and applying small axis
scale changes and rotations.  This is done using objects (usually stars) in
the exposures.  Unlike a full WCS calibration, which requires a high
density of stars with accurate catalog coordinates, the adjustments to the
default WCS calibration require only a few objects; only one objects is
needed to provide a zero point correction.

The WCS adjustments are determined by specifying coordinates for one or
more objects in the data.  The coordinates can be obtained from a reference
catalog or, more commonly, by measuring coordinates from one reference
exposure to which other exposures are to be "registered".  A combination of
using a catalog coordinate for one object in the field to set the zero
point in a reference exposure and then measuring the positions of other
stars in the reference image based on that zero point calibration may also
be done.

The two tasks you will use are \fBmsczero\fR and \fBmsccmatch\fR.
\fBMsczero\fR is used to interactively set the zero point of the
coordinates, register multiple exposures closely, and generate a list of
coordinates in a reference exposure to which other exposures in a dither
set are registered.  \fBMsccmatch\fR finds objects at the positions
specified by a list of coordinates and determines corrections for the zero
point, axis scale change, and axis rotation.

.sh
4.3.1 Setting Coordinate Zero Points and Measuring Coordinates

\fBMsczero\fR is an interactive display task for mosaic exposures that
allows measuring coordinates and adjusting the WCS zero point.  The task
parameters are shown below.  The last set of parameters (starting with
"ra") are for the task to query and maintain lists.

.nf
			     I R A F  
	      Image Reduction and Analysis Facility
    PACKAGE = mscred
       TASK = msczero

    images  =             List of mosaic exposures
    (nframes=          2) Number of frames to use
    (logfile=    default) Log file for measurements

    ra      =             RA (hours)
    dec     =             DEC (degrees)
    update  =        yes  Update WCS zero point?
    (fd1    =           )
    (fd2    =           )
.fi

The task displays each exposure in the list, in turn, and responds to
cursor key commands.  You can go forward and backward through the input
list or quit at any point.  The exposures are displayed by cycling through
the specified number of frames starting with the first frame.  As an aid to
efficiency, if the exposure is already loaded in the appropriate frame then
the display step is skipped.

This task has several uses (type '?' to get the list of command options):

.nf
    1. Set the WCS zero point by specifying the coordinate of a star.
    2. Create a list of coordinates for use with \fBmsccmatch\fR and \fBmscimatch\fR.
    3. Report coordinates at the cursor position.
.fi

It may be that the WCS zero points, based on the telescope
pointing coordinates, are accurate enough that you can use this task on
only a reference exposure to generate a list of coordinates for use with
\fBmsccmatch\fR and \fBmscimatch\fR.  However, because it is fairly quick
to explicitly check and set the zero point of all the exposures in a dither
set to the same coordinate for a common reference star, it is recommended
you do this first.

To check and set the zero points for a set of dithered exposures run
\fBmsczero\fR with a list of the exposures

.nf
    ms> msczero @field1
.fi

After the first exposure is displayed either find a reasonably bright
unsaturated star which will be in all the exposures or find a star whose
coordinate is known from a catalog such as the HST Guide Star Catalog.
Move the cursor to the star and type 'z' (zero) to invoke a centering algorithm.
Note that even though the exposure may be displayed at lower resolution the
centering is done with the full resolution data.  The task will then tell
you what it thinks the coordinate is and ask you for a new coordinate.  The
first time 'z' is typed it will prompt with the measured coordinate and
thereafter it will prompt with the last entered value.  If you are
referencing all the exposures to the first exposure in the list accept the
measured coordinate (and write the value down in case you need it later)
otherwise enter the desired coordinate.

Note that all further measurements of the image will automatically
apply the measured zero point correction but the exposure WCS is not
actually updated until you type 'n' (next) or 'q' (quit).  If you want to print
coordinates without changing the zero point correction use the space bar
or 'c' (center) to center on an object and print the centered coordinate.

If you changed the WCS zero point you will be shown the zero point offsets and
given the option to update the WCS in the data file when you type 'n'.
Then the next exposure in the list will be displayed.  Find the same star
and type 'z' again.  Since it will retain the last entered coordinate you
should only need to accept the prompted coordinates.  When you have done
this for all the exposures their coordinate systems will be registered at
least at that point.

The WCS in the dither set may still not be registered over all the field due
to refraction effects.  Also the intensity scales of the dithered exposures
may not be the same due to changes in transparency and sky brightness.
These effects are calibrated by matching objects throughout the
field in position and brightness.  This requires a list of coordinates
tied to one of the dithered exposures as a reference.  Usually the
first exposure in the set is used as the reference.  \fBMsczero\fR
is used to create a list from objects in the reference exposure.

.nf
    ms> msczero obj021
.fi

Select objects, usually stars, throughout the field and type 'x' for each
one.  This will center on the object and and record the coordinate in a
logfile.  The default logfile name "default" creates a log file
beginning with "Coords." and followed by the name of the exposure.
In the example this will be "Coords.obj021".

To be useful for coordinate matching this list should have a good
number of stars, say three or four from each CCD, with emphasis on the
field edges but allowing for the dithering.  For the intensity matching you
want to have stars with a range of brightness (though not saturated or
extremely faint) and which are mostly isolated so that a region around them
may be used for sky.  The lists for the coordinate and intensity matching
do not have to be the same but it is reasonable to just create one
list.

.sh
4.3.2 Matching Coordinate Systems

The task \fBmsccmatch\fR determines and applies a linear correction to the
WCS to match objects, generally stars, in an exposure
to a set of reference celestial coordinates.  This correction maintains the
detector geometry and optical distortions while adjusting for changes in
apparent sky position such as produced by atmospheric refraction and
telescope pointing errors.  The linear correction consists of a zero point
shift, scale changes in the right ascension and declination axes, and
rotations of the axes.

To use this task you need a list of reference celestial coordinates, right
ascension in hours and declination in degrees, and the mosaic exposure
coordinate system must be relatively close to the reference coordinate
system.  The default WCS plus telescope pointing may be close enough, but if
not you would use \fBmsczero\fR to register the zero points at some point
in the exposures.  Since it is relatively simple to register a set of
dithered exposures to a common star with \fBmsczero\fR this is
recommended procedure before using \fBmsccmatch\fR.

The reference coordinates should cover all of the mosaic field of
view to be sensitive to the small rotation and scale effects.  The
coordinate list might be obtained from a catalog or measured from one of the
exposures to which other overlapping exposures will be matched.
For the purposes of making a well aligned stacked image from a set of
dithered exposures one generally uses one of the exposures as the
source of the reference coordinates.

\fBMsccmatch\fR operates on a set of input mosaic exposures; each in turn.
For an exposure it converts each input celestial coordinate to a pixel
coordinate in one of the extensions using the current WCS.  If the
coordinate does not fall in any extension the coordinate is not used.  The
pixel coordinate is used as a starting point for the \fBapphot.center\fR
task.  If the centering fails for some reason, such as the object being too
near the edge or the final position being too far from the initial
position, the coordinate is not used.  For those objects successfully found
a fit is made between the original celestial coordinates and the measured
coordinates expressed as arc seconds from the exposure tangent point.  The
fit is constrained to yield some combination of shift, scale change, and
rotation for each of the celestial coordinate axes.  These parameters are
then used to update the exposure WCS so that the adjusted measured
coordinates best agrees with the reference coordinates.

The task parameters are shown below.

.nf
                               I R A F  
                Image Reduction and Analysis Facility
    PACKAGE = mscred
        TASK = msccmatch

    input   =               List of input mosaic exposures
    coords  =               Coordinate file (ra/dec)
    (nfit   =            4) Min for fit (>0) or max not found (<=0)
    (rms    =           2.) Maximum fit RMS to accept (arcsec)
    (maxshif=           5.) Maximum centering shift (arcsec)
    (fitgeom=     rxyscale) Fitting geometry
    (update =          yes) Update coordinate systems?
    (interac=          yes) Interactive?
    (fit    =          yes) Interactive fitting?
    (verbose=          yes) Verbose?
    accept  =          yes  Accept solution?
.fi

The input is a list of mosaic exposures and a file of reference
celestial coordinates.  The exposures should all include a significant
number of objects from the list of coordinates.

The task can be run interactively or non-interactively based on the
"interactive" parameter.  In interactive mode you can graphically
interact with the fitting (selected with the "fit" parameter) and
accept or reject a fit based on the printed fit parameters.  The fitting is
done using the task \fBgeomap\fR and the interactive mode allows you to
view the distribution of coordinates, residuals verses the input
coordinates, delete bad values, and possibly change the fitting constraints
(see the help for \fBgeomap\fR for more information).

The linear transformation may be constrained by the "fitgeometry"
parameter as described in the help for \fBgeomap\fR.  This may be
desirable if there are only a few coordinates or if you want to impose
some physical assumption.  Note that the effects of atmospheric refraction
actually do cause independent scale changes and rotations in the
two axes so the default "rxyscale" should be used.

There are some constraints which are placed on the task.  The
"maxscale" parameter limits how far the objects may be found from the
initial coordinates.  This constraint protects against incorrect
identifications and tells the centering routine how much of the image to
look at.  This parameter should be as small as possible consistent with the
errors in the WCS.  If you first zero the coordinates then the objects
should be found quite close to the initial coordinates.  When the
"verbose" parameter is set the results of the centering will be printed
consisting of the image extension name, the final pixel coordinates, the
shift in pixel coordinates from the initial value, and the formal
uncertainties in the pixel coordinates.  If an error occurs one of the
error codes from \fBapphot.center\fR will be reported such as "BigShift"
for objects with too big a shift from the initial position and "EdgeImage"
for objects to near the edge of the image.

The "nfit" parameter requires a certain number of coordinates to
be included in the fit.  If specified as a negative number the parameter
is interpreted as a maximum number that may be lost from the input
list due to being off the exposure or failing to be centered.  The
"rms" parameter requires that the final RMS of the residuals about
the fit for each axis be less than a certain value.

4.4 Putting the Pieces Together

This section tells you how to make single images from each multiextension
exposure and how to combine sets of dithered images into a final deep image
free from gaps and artifacts.  Obtaining good results depends on having
well-flattened data, a uniform sky, a dither pattern that samples the gaps
and bad regions of the detectors, and accurately registered world
coordinates.  Most difficulties are caused by variable sky conditions or
scattered light within a dither sequence or the data used to create a sky
flat.

.sh
4.4.1 Removing Sky Gradients

Any sky level mismatches when combining dithered exposures produce
artifacts in the final image.  The three sources of such mismatches are sky
gradients, sky level differences between the CCDs, and sky level
differences between exposures.  While the flat field calibration,
particularly with a sky flat, should remove differences in sky levels
between CCDs, in practice there may still be small errors.  And the flat
field will not deal with sky gradients across the large field of view.
Exposure-to-exposure sky brightness variations can be dealt with at a later
stage but even this is tricky.

The best final result is obtained by fitting a low order surface (a plane
or quadratic) to the sky and subtracting it from each CCD of each object
exposure at this stage.  This will force the sky to be zero for all CCDs
and all exposures.  Note that if one wants to preserve a sky level for
statistical reasons it is possible to add a uniform constant after the
subtraction to all the data (or add the constant to the final dither
stacked image).

To fit and subtract a sky and sky gradient the combination of
\fBimsurfit\fR and \fBmsccmd\fR is used.  With \fBimsurfit\fR use the
option to fit to medians in large blocks to remove the effects of objects.

.nf
    ms> msccmd
    msccmd: imsurfit $input $output xo=2 yo=2 type=resid xm=100 ym=100 
    Input files: obj*
    Output files: obj*
    msccmd: q
.fi

In this example the input and output are the same, replacing the original
by the sky subtracted data, but one can create new output files if
desired.  Note that x and y orders of 2 correspond to a plane and orders of
3 correspond to a quadratic surface.

.sh
4.4.2 Constructing Single Images

Making a single image from a mosaic exposure is done by mapping the pixels
from each extension to a single uniform grid on the sky.  The WCS
calibrations described in previous sections provide this.  For making
a single image from a single exposure the WCS calibration is not critical
and the default WCS is sufficient.  For combining multiple dithered
exposures all the exposures must be registered to a common coordinate system,
either relative to one reference exposure or to a set of catalog
stars, and each exposure must be resampled to the same final
coordinate system.

The task that makes single images from mosaic exposures is \fBmscimage\fR.
Its parameters are shown below.

.fi

An output image is created for each input mosaic exposure.  The output
image is created with a coordinate system defined by the specified
"reference" image.  If no reference image is specified then the first
input mosaic exposure is used to define a simple tangent plane coordinate
system with optical distortions removed, and that coordinate system is used
for all the input mosaic exposures.  The important point is that for a set
of dithered exposures all the output images must be created with the same
coordinate system grid so that they may be combined by simple integer
shifts along the image axes.

The normal usage is to specify all the mosaic exposures in a dither set as
the input, give a matching list of output images, and leave the reference image unspecified.  If all the exposures in a dither set are not done at the
same time then you must specify one of the earlier output images as the
reference image to continue to create the output images on the same
coordinate grid.

The output images are created with a size that just covers the input data
and initially filled with the specified "blank" value.  This is the
value that the mosaic gaps will have in the final output image.  Then each
extension is resampled into the appropriate part of the output image.  The
coordinate mapping is generated by \fBgeomap\fR using the geometric mapping
parameters which you don't need to change.  The resampling is done with the
specified interpolation function.  The small rotations in the CCDs produce
edge effects in the interpolated output pieces so a small trim is required
to eliminate these.  [At the time this document was prepared the best value
for the new science grade NOAO Mosaic had not been determined.]

Linear interpolation is the fastest and most straightforward.  Other
interpolation functions are available.  In particular sinc interpolation is
now available as an add-on option (see the \fBmscred\fR installation
instructions).  Experience with sinc interpolation shows that it is not
overly slow and does provide improved results; particularly with
maintaining the statistical characteristics of the sky noise.  The
"minterpolant" parameter allows using a faster and more local interpolation
function for the mask.  This is particularly useful when using sinc
interpolation of the data to allow flagging only around the actual bad
pixels and not extending out as far as the sinc interpolation does.

It is useful for the later combining step to make bad pixel masks that
reflect the interpolation and resampling from the input data.  These
may be created by setting the "pixmask" parameter.  If this parameter
is set and the input mosaic data have bad pixel masks defined through
the header BPM keywords (default bad pixel masks are provided in
the NOAO Mosaic data) then the masks will be interpolated in exactly
the same way as the data.  The interpolated masks will appear in the
working directory with names related to the output image names and
with the output images containing the BPM keyword pointing to these
masks.  The input bad pixel masks are assumed to have zero for good
data and one for bad data and the output masks have zero for good
data and values between zero and ten thousand for bad data.  The
value is the result of interpolation and reflects the relative
contribution of good and bad data.

The "fluxconserve" parameter applies a pixel area correction if
selected.  As discussed earlier, standard flat fielding distorts the flux
per unit area in pixels of different projected size by making them have the
same flux per pixel.  In effect this applies half of the flux conservation
operation by adjusting the pixel values without adjusting the pixel sizes.
\fBMscimage\fR does the second half by adjusting the pixel sizes.  So for
standard flat fielded data, the usual route to making a combined dithered
image, the flux conservation parameter should not be used to arrive at a
proper final flux per unit area in the resampled data.  Flux conservation
would only be used if the input mosaic data has previously been corrected
back to proper flux per unit area through adjustment of the flat field or
data for the variable pixel size inherent in the mosaic coordinate system.

Below are two examples; one using prepared @files and one illustrating
advanced usage of filename templates.

.nf
    ms> mscimage @dither1 @outdither1 pixmask+
    ms> mscimage obj02![2-5]* %obj%mos%02![2-5]* pixmask+
.fi

In the second example the input template expands to obj022.fits to
obj025.fits and the output template matches the input template using the
first part of the %% substitution field and then replaces the "obj" with
"mos" to give output images mos022.fits to mos025.fits.

.sh
4.4.3 Matching Intensity Scales

When stacking dithered exposures (the single images created in the previous
step) to fill in the mosaic gaps and remove bad pixels and cosmic ray
events it is critical that the intensity scales of the images match.
Otherwise you will see artifacts from the gaps, places with bad data, and
around objects as the combined intensity level jumps when data from an
exposure is missing or rejected.  Also the rejection algorithms require
that the image intensities match both at the sky level and in the objects.

There are two parameters that must be determined to match the intensity
scales.  One is a additive offset caused by sky brightness variations.  The
second is a multiplicative scale change caused by transparency and exposure
time variations.  Matching the intensity scales for a set of dithered
exposures consists of determining values for these two scaling parameters
relative to a reference exposure and setting them in the image headers.
The actual adjustment of the pixels values occurs when stacking the
exposures.

The intensity matching values are determined by the task \fBmscimatch\fR.
The task parameters are shown below.

    (box2   =       51) Outer box size for statistics
    (lower  =       1.) Lower limit for good data
    (upper  =    INDEF) Upper limit for good data
    (niterat=        3) Number of sigma clipping iterations
    (sigma  =       3.) Sigma clipping factor
    (interac=       no) Interactive?
    (verbose=      yes) Verbose?
.fi

The input is a list of images to be matched and a file of celestial
coordinates (RA in hours and DEC in degrees) to use in computing the
matching parameters.  The input images are the single images constructed
from the mosaic exposures for a set of dithered observations.

The parameters "scale" and "zero" select whether to determine the
multiplicative scale, the zero level offsets, or both.  If the sky has been
subtracted at an earlier stage (as recommended) then only the
multiplicative scale difference needs to be determined.  The advantage of
subtracting the sky earlier is that scale determination becomes better
constrained.  Also determining the sky from photometry (as done by this
task) is less robust than the surface fitting which uses all of the sky
data.

The scaling parameters are determined by measuring the mean flux in a set
of matching regions between each input image.  The centers of the regions
are specified by their celestial coordinates.  The list of coordinates
should consist of the positions of objects in the field.  These objects
should span a range of brightness.  As noted previously, you would normally
use the same coordinate list as used with \fBmsccmatch\fR, which is
generally obtained using \fBmsczero\fR.  However, you can use any IRAF task
that produces a list of celestial coordinates from images with a WCS.  One
possibility is to use \fBrimcursor\fR on one of the displayed single images
with the "wcs" parameter set to "world" and the "wxformat" set to
"%.2H" to produce right ascension values in hours instead of degrees.

The now accurately aligned coordinate systems in the images are used to
identify the matching pixel coordinate center in each image.  The regions
to be measured consist of square boxes of the specified sizes about the
pixel coordinate center.  There are two boxes, an inner box and an outer
box which excludes the inner box.  The box sizes are intended to define
photometry apertures for the objects and nearby background.  It is not
critical that they exactly fit the objects or that the objects necessarily
be stars but this is usually how they will be set.  Because of possible PSF
variations the inner box should be large enough include all the light from
stars over the whole data set.

If the inner box is not fully contained in the input or reference image
that box is not used for that pair.  Similarly the outer box must be fully
contained in the images but if only the outer box is outside one or both
images the measurement for the inner box may still be used.

In order to exclude regions that include the gaps or bad data in one or
both of the pair of images all pixels in a box must have values between the
specified good data limits.  Those regions with values outside the limits
are eliminated from the intensity matching.

The mean fluxes in each region are used to simultaneously fit the relations

.nf
    mean_j = A_ij + B_ij * mean_i
.fi

for all i and j where i and j are any pair of images.  These equations are
constrained by the fact that the scaling from image i to j, followed by the
scaling from image j to k, must agree with the scaling from image i to
image k.  The final scaling coefficients reported and stored in the image
header are A_1j and B_1j, which correspond to the scalings to the first
image in the input list.

The task will attempt to reject photometry points which are discrepant.
If the task is run interactively it will also show plots of the photometry
flux in one image verses another.  It does this for sequential pairs of
images.  Points can be deleted in these plots and they will be excluded
from the data used to determine the scaling parameters.

When the task is done determining the scaling factors they will be printed
and a prompt issued to accept or not accept the results.  If the scaling
parameters are accepted then the keywords \fBmsczero\fR and \fBmscscale\fR
are recorded in the input image header when the "update" parameter is
set.  Note that the reference image is assigned values of 0 and 1 for these
header keywords.

4.4.4 Making the Final Stack Image

After \fBmscimage\fR produces single images of each of the dithered mosaic
exposures with a common coordinate system grid, a final image is created
with the task \fBmscstack\fR.  The task \fBmscimatch\fR is generally used
to match the intensity scales of the images before this step as described
in the previous section.  However, for quick reductions or for other
reasons the images may be stacked either with no intensity matching or
using the "scale" and "zero" options of \fBmscstack\fR.  The task
parameters are shown below.

    (mclip  =        yes) Use median in sigma clipping algorithms?
    (lsigma =         3.) Lower sigma clipping factor

    (grow   =          0) Radius (pixels) for 1D neighbor rejection
.fi

This task is a simple variant of \fBcombine\fR that registers the images
using the coordinate systems and has the default threshold parameters set
to ignore values below one DN based on the default "blank"
value in \fBmscimage\fR for the gaps.  If you have also generated
bad pixel masks for the resampled images you can exclude them as well by
setting "masktype" to "goodvalue".

The real art in using this task is deciding how to scale and reject
bad data not covered by the bad pixel masks.  A "combine" of "median"
is the simplest but it does not optimize the signal-to-noise for the
number of images.  If you "average" the data you will probably want
to apply a rejection algorithm such as "avsigclip".

Careful flat fielding will make each separate image have the same sky
level across the different CCDs.  However, the sky levels and transparency
may still be varying from exposure to exposure.  If you simply combine
such data you will see imprints of the gaps.  So it is generally a
good idea to scale the images.  This is done using the "scale"
and "zero" parameters which can be set to header keyword values,
files containing the values, or special values to compute image
statistics in a particular region of the data.  The recommended
method for scaling is to use the intensity matching task \fBmscimatch\fR
described in the previous section and use the image header keywords
\fBmscscale\fR and \fBmsczero\fR produced by that task.

An example of using this task to create a final image is given below.
